# The-Future-Hotel-Analysis
Using booking data to derive insights and advice hotel management.

The longer the lead time, the higher the chances the booking will be canceled. While a 120-day lead time may be advisable based on available data, the hotel may exercise caution and aim for around or below a 90-day lead time.

Bookings made for two adult occupants have shown the highest tendencies of being canceled. While this is the most regular type of booking (making over 60% of bookings), it is important that special attention is paid to this category. Understandably, bookings of three and four adults would imply family bookings. These would usually be for a holiday or weekend treat and would, in most cases, not be canceled. This basket of bookings is small, and we may want to pay more attention to one-adult and two-adult bookings.

As seen from the number of children statistics, bookings with no children (basically within the one-adult and two-adult bookings) make up the majority of bookings. This is where attention needs to be paid. Bookings with children make less than 5% of total bookings under analysis.

The number of repeat guests is too small compared to new customers (932 vs. 35,388). This implies that guests at the hotel are either people who make a one-time visit to the location for business or pleasure. It could also be that guests were not satisfied with their first visit, which deters them from subsequent patronage.

It is important to note that Room Type 1 gets the highest bookings and also the highest repeat bookings, albeit a very small amount. This may imply that the price of the room may be the cheapest. Next to this is Room Type 4.

The arrival date plays a crucial role in the cancellation trend. The number of cancellations drops significantly (compared to not-canceled bookings) for the (pre/post) festive months of November through January. As expected, these are holiday periods, which command high traffic either for extended stays or in-transit guests (which may support the hypothesis of high first-time bookings vis-a-vis repeat bookings). Comparing 2017 and 2018 data, it is obvious that cancellations surged even during festive months. Depending on the location of the hotel and where the traffic is coming from, one may want to look at the economic conditions of the location, as this may be the reason for such a surge, with the economy being stiffer in 2018 than in 2017.

While data from January till June 2017 is not available, hotel management needs to look at bookings with arrival dates from June to October, as there may be events or occurrences resulting in cancellations for arrivals in those months.

Room types 1 to 3 seem to be the cheapest (below $100), but only Room Type 1 gets more patronage. It is either Room Types 2 and 3 are not well set up, or they are not being promoted enough. Room Type 7 is the most expensive.
